# Worth2Watch - "goodness" prediction based on movie overviews 

This project contains the documentation for our Introduction to Data Science project 'Worth2Watch', which uses movie overviews to determine if they are worth watching or not. 

The movie data was gathered from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), preprocessed with pandas and model made using NLTK.

A live version of the project can be viewed at http://worth2watch.herokuapp.com
