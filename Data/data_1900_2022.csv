For Buxton Skyline, Mitchell and Kenyon made a relatively rare departure from their more typical scenes of bustling crowds. The long, slow panning shot is unusually ambitious for this early period in film's history, and it's not surprising that keeping the camera steady proved a challenge too far given the technology available."
